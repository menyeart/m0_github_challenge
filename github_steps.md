# GitHub Steps

Describe in your own words how to establish a connection between a local repository and a remote repository on GitHub.

- Create a GitHub repository and name it the same as the local repository.
Follow the directions under `...or push an existing repository from the command line` by running the following commands:
  ''' - git remote add origing
      - git@github.com:USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git
      - git branch -M main (don't need to do if you have configured GIT to name the default branch main)
      -git push -u origin main ```
- Return to your GitHub browerser tab. Refresh it to see the new repository.
